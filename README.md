poop
====

chef-inspired configuration management in bash.

With all the food related names like cuisine, chef, microwave, why not
poop?  You start with a recipe, cook a meal, eat it, digest, and the end
result is poop.  And what can you do with it?  Grow more food!

Look at recipes/meh for an example.  To turn this recipe into poop, run:

    bin/poop meh
